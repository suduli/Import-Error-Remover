**Content Cleaner for tst Files**

This Python script is designed to remove specific patterns from C files, particularly content between TEST.IMPORT_FAILURES: and TEST.END_IMPORT_FAILURES: without affecting the surrounding lines.

**How It Works**

The script uses regular expressions to identify and remove content blocks that start with TEST.IMPORT_FAILURES: and end with TEST.END_IMPORT_FAILURES:. The surrounding whitespace is preserved to ensure the integrity of the original file's structure.

**Usage**

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

Run the script using the command:

python content_cleaner.py

When prompted, enter the path to the C file you wish to clean.

The script will process the file and remove the specified content blocks.

**Code Overview**

The clean_file_content function is responsible for identifying and removing the content blocks.

The main function handles file reading, content cleaning, and file writing.

The script execution starts from the if __name__ == "__main__": line, ensuring that the cleaning process only runs when the script is executed directly.
